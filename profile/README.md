## üìñ About The Project

**Moonchain** is a high-performance zkEVM Layer 2 network built on the BNB Chain. It is engineered to serve as the foundational **Value Relayer** for the rapidly growing Decentralized AI and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) industries.

Our mission is to solve the critical problems of fragmentation, trust, and inefficient scaling that hold back the decentralized AI economy. We do this by:
1.  **Bootstrapping a Global Hardware Network** through our innovative **Initial Hardware Offering (IHO)** platform.
2.  **Verifying Off-Chain Activity** using cutting-edge ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs, creating a universal layer of trust.
3.  **Unifying Disparate Networks** by providing a single, secure, and efficient layer for value settlement and data exchange.

This repository contains the core source code for the Moonchain node and related infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   ‚ö°Ô∏è **ZK-Powered Verification:** Leverage the power of Zero-Knowledge proofs to trustlessly verify off-chain computations and data integrity, enabling a new class of secure dApps.
*   Á°¨‰ª∂ **Initial Hardware Offering (IHO) Platform:** Our unique "Stake-for-Asset" model transforms token utility, allowing us to rapidly deploy a global, community-owned physical hardware network.
*   üß† **AI & DePIN Native:** Designed from the ground up to support the high-throughput and specialized needs of AI applications and DePIN protocols.
*   üîê **BNB Chain Security:** Inherits the robust security and liquidity of the BNB Chain while offering drastically lower fees and faster transaction processing.
